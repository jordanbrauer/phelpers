<br />

A collection of random quality of life functions for PHP – a sort of _toolbox_.

## Requirements

There are not many requirements for this library; infact, the only true requirement is PHP, but if you plan to contribute, having GNU Make installed will make for nicer dev experience than without.

| Requirement      | Version |
|:-----------------|:-------:|
| PHP              | `^7.2`  |
| Make (dev only)  | `^3.81` |

## Installation

Nothing much to do but require the library in your own project's composer dependencies!

```bash
$ composer require jordanbrauer/phelpers
```

Once you have the library installed, head over to the list of [**available functions**](#Available-Functions) to shop around.

## Development

1. Start by cloning the project to your own machine.
1. Move yourself into the newly cloned repository directory.
1. Run make to install dev dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jordanbrauer/phelpers.git \
    && cd ./phelpers \
    && make vendor \
    && make;
```

### Usage 

As mentioned in the _Requirements_ section of this document, having GNU Make installed on your system will make for nice development experience while contributing. To get started, run Make without any targets or arguments:

```bash
$ make
```

And you will be greeted with the list of targets for this project!

```
Usage:
  make [target] [arg="val"...]

Targets:
  analysis        Run analysis
  help            Show this help message
  repl            Start a REPL instance and interact with the library
  test            Run tests
  vendor          Install vendor dependencies
```

### Try Me

If you're not sure that this library is right for you, can "try before you buy". Start by [installing the project for development](#Development), and then simply boot up [the **REPL**](https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh) packaged with the repository!

```bash
$ make repl
```

Using the functions is easy – just make sure that you preface your functions with the projects namespace first.

```php
λ Phelpers\is_console() # true
λ Phelpers\is_web()     # false
```
